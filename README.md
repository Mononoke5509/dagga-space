# Dagga Space ðŸ‘½

A simple and accessible cannabis guide and blog with no invasive tracking, ads, or offers. Dagga Space is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) v2.

## Running the app locally

NB: Dagga Space requires Node version 16+.

- Clone this repo
- Using the terminal of your choice, execute `npm i` inside the repo folder
- After all dependecies have been installed, execute `npm start` to run a dev build of the app locally
- Execute `npm run build` and then `npm run serve` to run a production build of the app locally

## Contributing to the blog

Dagga Space is blog-ready. Post contributions should therefore typically only require `.md` or `.mdx` files. Posts will only be accepted via pull-request for now.
